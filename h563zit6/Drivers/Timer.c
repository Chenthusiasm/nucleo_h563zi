/**
 * @file    Timer.c
 * @brief   Interface file for the Timer driver.
 * @note    The driver is reentrant from the defined structures; the driver may not be reentrant
 *          if different instances of the structures are constructed using the same HW peripherals,
 *          specifically timers (TIM). To ensure reentrancy, the Mutex module must be configured
 *          to use an RTOS mutex.
 * @note    This driver is not fully platform since it's possible for multiple instances to be
 *          constructed with the same TIM and channel leading to multiple instances being able to
 *          configure the same hardware independent of each other.
 * @note    The timer driver only supports the following modes: basic PWM mode and encoder mode
 *          (both channels 1 and 2).
